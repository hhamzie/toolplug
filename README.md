Hey this is my ai run newsletter! 

It automatically goes through the top products of the week, based off whatever category u pick, and sends u an email (once a week) at 2pm on the day of ur choosing. 
It sends a small email in regards to one software product from one of the categories you selected that is most upvoted on product hunt. 
All emails are ai generated, and are completely hands off and automatic. 


Current Problems: 

- Must access emails on same browser in order for it to work
